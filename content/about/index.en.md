## :mag: The way I work

I believe that building quality applications starts with a deep understanding of the business domain.
That’s why I always start by **learning your business, challenges, and goals** before crafting technical solutions.

I make sure to grasp the **why** before using my technical skills to solve the **how**.

I develop products with an emphasis on **quality, durability, and maintainability**. I promote best practices
and industry standards such as **Clean Architecture** and **Test Driven Development**.

This means that my work can be taken over by any experienced developer. **Every piece of software I deliver is fully
tested and documented**.

This mindset allows me to create **bespoke, adaptable, and future-proof software**.

## :seedling: My continuous learning

In the world of software development, things evolve quickly, very quickly. New technologies emerge while others
become obsolete almost overnight.

Staying up to date through continuous learning is essential in this field.

This is why **I invest at least 10% of my annual revenue in training every year**: learning new languages and frameworks,
discovering new methodologies, exploring AI-based solutions...

## :robot: My use of AI

In recent years, AI has taken center stage in the software industry, becoming almost impossible to ignore,
and reshaping development practices.

As for me, **AI serves as a powerful assistant**, but only for topics where I am capable of critically evaluating
the generated suggestions.

While this offers a significant productivity boost, I will never compromise on the quality and maintainability
of the solutions I deliver.
