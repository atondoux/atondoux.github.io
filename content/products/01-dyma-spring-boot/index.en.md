## :package: About the Product

This course is intended for both beginners and experienced developers, offering the opportunity to discover
a proven stack for building enterprise-grade web applications and microservices.

Inspired by discussions with Dymaâ€™s co-founders, I was convinced by their vision and educational approach.
The platform focuses above all on content quality by providing only one course per subject.
Each course is maintained and updated by its creator.

After months of hard work, I am proud to have taken on the challenge! Publishing this course
taught me that teaching also trains the teacher :slightly_smiling_face: I will never forget the first time
I pressed the *rec* button to record the first lessons.
