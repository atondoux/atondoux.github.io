Helping speech therapists to make every session more effective for their patients.
{{< /lead >}}

## :package: About the Product

Inspired by the experiences of speech therapists around me, I noticed they spend significant time searching
for materials. As sessions follow one another throughout the day, they need to focus on their patients rather
than on logistical issues.

So I decided to create a tool that helps them, just before receiving a patient, to easily find the most relevant
and effective materials for that specific patient.

Ortho Assistant aims to save time and reduce mental load for speech therapists, allowing them
to dedicate more time to their patients and provide better care.

## :warning: Disclaimer

Ortho Assistant launched in production with several dozen speech therapists as beta testers.
However, due to a lack of time to further develop the product and limited user feedback,
the service is no longer available. 

Building this SaaS was a valuable learning experience, both from a technical and marketing perspective.
A redesign is being considered to deliver a better version of the service in the future.
