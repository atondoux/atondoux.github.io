  ## :mag: The way I work

  I believe that building quality applications starts with a deep understanding of the business domain. That's why I always start by **learning your business, challenges, and goals** before crafting technical solutions. I make sure to grasp the **why** before using my technical skills to solve the **how**.<br>
  <br>
  I develop products with an emphasis on **quality, durability, and maintainability**. I promote best practices and industry standards such as **Clean Architecture** and **Test Driven Development**.<br>
  <br>
  This means that my work can be taken over by any experienced developer. **Every piece of software I deliver is fully tested and documented**. This mindset enables me to deliver **applications that are tailored, flexible, and built to last**.

  ## :seedling: My continuous learning

  In the world of software development, things evolve quickly, very quickly. New technologies emerge while others become obsolete almost overnight.<br>
  <br>
  Staying up to date through continuous learning is essential in this field.<br>
  <br>
  This is why **I invest at least 10% of my annual revenue in training every year**: learning new languages and frameworks, discovering new methodologies, exploring AI-based solutions...

  ## :robot: My use of AI

  In recent years, AI has taken center stage in the software industry, becoming almost impossible to ignore, and reshaping development practices.<br>
  <br>
  As for me, **AI serves as a powerful assistant**, but only for topics where I am capable of critically evaluating the generated suggestions.<br>
  <br>
  While this offers a significant productivity boost, I will never compromise on the quality of the solutions I deliver.
