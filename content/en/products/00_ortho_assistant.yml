  ## :desktop_computer: About the Product

  Inspired by the experiences of speech therapists around me, I noticed they spend significant time searching for materials. As sessions follow one another throughout the day, they need to focus on their patients rather than on logistical issues.<br>
  <br>
  So I decided to create a tool that helps them, just before receiving a patient, to easily find the most relevant and effective materials for that specific patient.<br>
  <br>
  Ortho Assistant aims to save time and reduce mental load for speech therapists, allowing them to dedicate more time to their patients and provide better care.<br>

  ## :warning: Disclaimer

  Ortho Assistant launched in production with several dozen speech therapists as beta testers. However, due to a lack of time to further develop the product and limited user feedback, the service is no longer available. Building this SaaS was a valuable learning experience, both from a technical and marketing perspective. A redesign is being considered to deliver a better version of the service in the future.
